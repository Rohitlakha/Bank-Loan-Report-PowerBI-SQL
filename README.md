# 💳 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard – Power BI + SQL Server

This project presents a professional **Bank Loan Report Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, powered by data from **Microsoft SQL Server**. It provides a detailed view of loan applications, funding amounts, defaults, and performance indicators — optimized for business decision-making.

> 📌 Inspired by a real-world finance use case and extended for hands-on BI development.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design an end-to-end business intelligence solution that:
- Connects Power BI with SQL Server
- Cleans, models, and visualizes loan data
- Provides actionable insights for banking and lending institutions
- Sets a foundation for adding Python-based visualizations in the future

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- 🔹 **38K+ Total Loan Applications** analyzed
- 📈 **Monthly & MoM KPIs** for:
  - Funded Amount
  - Amount Received
  - Interest Rate
  - DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)
- 🟢 Good vs. 🔴 Bad Loan Segmentation
- 📋 Detailed **Loan Status Table** with:
  - Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current
  - Avg. Interest Rate, DTI, MTD Metrics
- 🔍 Slicers for **State**, **Grade**, **Purpose**, and **Loan Quality**
- 📁 Clean page navigation: Summary | Overview | Details

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (data source)
- **DAX** (for calculations and KPIs)
- **Python** (planned for visual enhancement)
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** (initial data staging)

---

## 🧠 Skills Applied

- SQL Querying and Data Transformation
- Data Modeling in Power BI
- DAX for calculated KPIs
- Interactive and Responsive UI/UX Design
- PPT Design for Project Presentation
